        <h1>My name is Dawit Ayana. I have a B.A in Criminal Justice from WSU. 
            I am now with Code Fellows and I am loving is so far.
            Coding is becoming my new passion. I had a business for 6 years, 
            but now I work for Mercedes Benz of Seattle. I love cars especially old schools.
            I enjoy outdoor activities like long boarding, biking and racing cars. My future goal 
            is to own my own business and to explore the world and teach people how to be financially free.  
            Water is my life.</h1>
